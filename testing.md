The website is really simple. I had my partner test it for me. His first task was simply to go into the website and 
do some research on the oil and gas industry in Taranaki. Once he'd done that, I told him that based on the 
information he'd gleaned that he should now try and donate to the organisation.

I changed a few things around on the home page, took off the archives bar and moved the search bar. I also grouped 
the information into drop down bars on the information page. So that instead of it being one long page, you click each
heading to find out more. i.e. you have to click 'health' to find out more about the health effects of the industry.
My partner seemed to think this made the page look like there was less to read, so he was less likely to click straight
out of it with a TL;DR attitude.

Even though I had my tester do really simple things, it was interesting and really valuable to get that input. I 
can see how this would be a really vital part of any design process.
