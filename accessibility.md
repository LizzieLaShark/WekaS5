-Added some legends
-Changed the ID for match for value (and also figured out that my use of ID had been wrong all along).
-created a select menu so I could practise with optgroup and added another legend to practise with that too.
-got a bit confused about why the last tutorial had me using [<ul>] and [<li>] </code> elements. Found out that the <code> <select> </code>
element doesnt really like them so moved them outside the element and continued on my way.
