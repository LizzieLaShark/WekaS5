To increase accesibility of this form I made the following changes:

-Added some legends
-Changed the ID for match for value (and also figured out that my use of ID had been wrong all along).
-created a select menu so I could practise with optgroup and added another legend to practise with that too.
-got a bit confused about why the last tutorial had me using ul and li elements. Found out that the select
 element doesnt really like them so moved them outside the element and continued on my way.
 
 To increase usability:
 
 -I tried to format it a bit better using CSS. I'm going to have to swot up on positioning because I had a bit of trouble with this.
-I added a logo, again it needs to be positioned properly
-Made the form name more specific and added a subheading.
-Made it easier to understand what the goal of the form it.
-Changed the submit button to 'subscribe to sauce lovers!'
